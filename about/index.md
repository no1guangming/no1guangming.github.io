→_→嗨，我是王光明，来自湖北黄冈，我在学习编程。

永远不要说“太迟了”。

对于少年来说，世界上没有“太迟”这件事，少年一直就在起跑线上，少年从来不认输。只有变老的人，才会这样。哎呦，我现在恋爱是不是太晚了，我现在学这个技能是不是太晚了。从来没有“太晚了”这件事，如果你不变老的话。想到什么，立即去做，即便明天就反悔，好歹也是尝试过了。如果不尝试，那又怎么会知道你会后悔呢？

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). I have used Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share. But, the content and opnion that you see here are personal and not related to companies / clients i work with. And regarding the code you see there.. you may use it as per your discretion.

## About this Theme

Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn't find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.

You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.
